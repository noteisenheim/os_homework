In C the output is buffered till it meets the newline character. Thus, in the first example "Hello" string is in the buffer when the fork() is called, thus,  both parent and child processes finish the output which was in a buffer and output "Hello". In the second example there is newline after the first print, thus, the output buffer is empty when a child process is created and it outputs only commands after the fork() call.
