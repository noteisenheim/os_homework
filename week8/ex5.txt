A virtual address - an address of data stored in virtual memory. As the virtual memory is usually larger than the physical (as otherwise having virtual memory makes no sense), the virtual addresses range is larger than physical. Also, we cannot directly access the virtual address for reading: firstly, we have to map the whole page to the physical memory to see if it is stored there and if no, we need to write it there. Also, same addresses do not mean that the data stored there is the same: each page is mapped somewhere (we do not exactly know where).
